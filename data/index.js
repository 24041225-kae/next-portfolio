        title: 'VR Escape Room Game',
        subtitle: 'In a Dream Tale, Navigating the surreal logic of a dark Grimm-inspired nightmare.',
        tech: ['Unity', 'C#'],
        description: `<strong>The Vision</strong>
In a Dream Tale is an immersive Virtual Reality experience that bridges the gap between folklore and "prophetic dream imagery." Drawing from the dark, unfiltered roots of the Brothers Grimm, this dark fantasy escape room places the player inside a haunting storybook world where the lines between childhood tales and adult nightmares are blurred.

<strong>Atmospheric Narrative</strong>
The journey begins with the player awakening in a suffocating, moonlit forest, shadowed by an enormous, glowing copy of Grimm’s Fairy Tales. Upon falling into a surreal tree hole, the player must navigate a series of rooms shaped by twisted logic:

<u>The Deception:</u> A crooked wooden house where the player must look beneath the surface—literally digging through soil—to find their way in.

<u>The Wolf’s Bed:</u> A puzzle centered on identifying the eerie stillness of a predator in disguise, requiring the player to complete the facade using objects tagged with "Grandma" and "Glasses."

<u>The Breadcrumb Path:</u> A whimsical yet unsettling "popsicle forest" where players must distinguish between the distractions (breadcrumbs) and the path to survival (glowing stones).

<u>The Final Confrontation:</u> A gingerbread house climax that demands a physical, high-stakes interaction to escape the "sugar-laced trap."

<strong>Key Selling Points</strong>
Thematic Puzzles: Unlike standard escape rooms that rely on codes, In a Dream Tale uses thematic mechanics. Players solve puzzles by engaging with the narrative of the tales—survival, deception, and temptation.

Immersive Interaction: Built for VR, the game utilises physical triggers, such as using a baker's paddle to collide with NPCs, and teleportation-based movement to allow for deep exploration of the eerie environments.

Dream Logic Aesthetic: The visual direction moves from the suffocating, high-contrast shadows of the forest to the unsettling, soft pastels of a whimsical trap, creating a "meaningful mystery" for the player to unravel.

Thematic Alignment
This project explores my personal core value of freedom. By navigating through these "storybook traps," the player undergoes a journey of resilience—rising above the "walls" of the nightmare to find their way back to the forest, symbolising the ultimate pursuit of self-discovery and agency.`,

Developed as a school project, this application is a dynamic travel blogging platform designed to bridge the gap between personal journaling and community interaction. The project focuses on providing a seamless interface for users to document their journeys while engaging with a wider network of travelers.

<strong>Core Functionality & User Engagement</strong>
The app is built on a full CRUD architecture, enhanced with social and navigational features:

<strong>Content Management</strong>: Full Create, Read, Update, and Delete capabilities for travel logs.

<strong>Smart Search & Routing</strong>: A custom search engine allows users to filter posts by country. If a destination exists in the database, the app automatically redirects the user to the specific travel page, streamlining the discovery process.

<strong>Social Interaction</strong>: To foster community, I implemented a dual-layer comment system:

<strong>Post-Specific Comments</strong>: Allows for targeted discussions on individual travel entries.

<strong>General Discussion Hub</strong>: A global comment section for general travel advice and community interaction.`,

        subtitle: 'Applying systemic logic and dynamic variables to sustainable design.',
        tech: ['Figma'],
        description: `<strong>The Vision</strong>
Greenweave is a high-fidelity sustainable e-commerce prototype designed to provide a frictionless, "green" shopping experience. Developed in Figma, the project serves as a study in Sustainable UX, where the design itself mirrors the eco-conscious values of the brand through efficiency and clarity.

<strong>Advanced Prototyping & Logic</strong>
To move beyond a static mockup, I utilised Figma’s advanced prototyping features to create a fully functional user experience:

<strong>Variables</strong>: Implemented to manage dynamic data like pricing, product names, and cart totals, ensuring a consistent and scalable design system.

<strong>Conditionals</strong>: Used logic-based interactions to handle complex user flows (e.g., if the cart is empty, then show a specific call-to-action). This demonstrates my ability to think in terms of system logic and state management, skills that are essential for game systems design.

<strong>Interactive Components</strong>: Developed reusable, state-aware components to ensure a seamless and responsive feel across the entire prototype.

<strong><u>The Design Process: Finding Greenweave</u></strong>
"In the initial stages, I experimented with several concept sketches and experimental layouts that didn't quite fit the brand’s identity. Some felt too cluttered or lacked the 'organic' feel I was aiming for. By iterating and testing these early ideas, I eventually arrived at the current Greenweave design—a solution that feels authentic, hopeful, and technically robust."`,

This project explores the intersection of graphic design and environmental storytelling. The goal was to create a travel poster that does more than advertise a location; it captures a "feeling" and a narrative, inviting the viewer to step into a different world. Using bold typography and atmospheric illustration, I focused on selling an experience of discovery and wonder.

<strong>Art Direction & Composition</strong>
Visual Hierarchy: I utilised a classic travel poster layout, using strong leading lines to draw the viewer’s eye from the foreground details up to the primary landmark and headline.

<strong>Color Palette</strong>: The colors were chosen to evoke a specific emotional response—using warm, hopeful tones to represent "possibility" or high-contrast, moody shades to suggest "mystery," aligning with my personal brand's aesthetic.

<strong>Typography</strong>: I selected typefaces that reflect the character of the destination—balancing modern, clean sans-serifs with stylised display fonts to create a "modern yet timeless" look.`,

        description: `A logo made from the initials of my name.

<strong>Concept & Personal Identity</strong>
This logo serves as a visual manifestation of my identity, centering on the initials "K.Y." for my Chinese name, Kai Yun. The design utilises bold, geometric letterforms to project a sense of clarity, confidence, and structural strength.

<strong>Symbolism: The Wings of Aspiration</strong>
The defining feature of the mark is the stylised wing motif layered behind the typography. Inspired by the theme of freedom, these wings represent my core values: the drive to rise above challenges and the pursuit of unlimited possibilities. It is a nod to the "Wings of Freedom"—symbolising a hopeful outlook and the resilience required to seek a meaningful life.

<strong>Color Theory & Mood</strong>
The choice of a monochromatic, neutral palette was driven by a curated moodboard reflecting my personality.

<u><strong>Black & Dark Tones</strong>: Evoke mystery and the depth of self-discovery.</u>

<u><strong>White & Light Gray</strong>: Maintain a sense of openness and hope.</u>


<strong>Intentionality</strong>: The minimalist scheme ensures the logo is modern and versatile, while the underlying theme of "love in life’s little things" ensures the design feels grounded and authentic rather than cold.</u>`,
        additionalInfo: `<strong>Design Architecture</strong>
As a Combination Mark, this project marries a symbolic logomark (the wings) with a logotype (the initials). This duality ensures strong brand recognition while providing a rich narrative layer. The result is a professional identity that mirrors my quiet ambition and desire for thoughtful self-expression.`,

        tech: ['Unity', 'Blender'],
        description: `<strong>The Vision</strong>
This project redefines the traditional professional introduction by transforming a static namecard into a dynamic Augmented Reality (AR) experience. The project centers on a 3D avatar named Apollo, designed to act as a digital ambassador of my creative philosophy.

<strong>Symbolism: Apollo, the Sun God</strong>
I chose the name Apollo—the Greek God of the Sun—because he represents hope, light, and clarity.

<strong>Thematic Alignment</strong>: In my personal brand, I strive to embody a sense of "unlimited possibilities" and "aspiration." By manifesting Apollo as a Lego-inspired character, I’ve combined the ancient symbol of hope with a modern, playful aesthetic that represents the joy of building and creation.

<strong><u>3D Craftsmanship & Technical Execution</u></strong>
<strong>3D Modeling (Blender)</strong>: I custom-modeled the Apollo character in Blender, focusing on clean geometry and a high-gloss, vibrant finish. The choice of a "Lego" form factor signifies that great designs are built piece-by-piece with intentionality.

<strong>AR Integration (Unity)</strong>: Using Unity, I developed an AR application that uses image-target recognition. When a user views my physical namecard through the app, Apollo appears in 3D space, bridging the gap between the physical and digital worlds.

<strong>UX Design</strong>: The interaction is designed to be a "moment of light," providing a high-impact, memorable experience that demonstrates my technical proficiency in 3D pipelines and spatial computing.

<strong>Thematic Connection</strong>
Apollo serves as a literal and metaphorical "light" in my portfolio. Much like the wings in my personal logo, this AR character represents a desire to rise above the ordinary. It reflects my identity: a digital designer who values freedom, self-discovery, and the quiet ambition to create meaningful, hopeful experiences.`,

<strong>The Logic</strong>
To handle the interactive complexity, we moved beyond basic web tools to a more advanced stack:

<u>Next.js & Tailwind CSS</u>: Chosen for optimized performance and rapid, consistent UI styling across multiple interactive game states.

<u>Anime.js</u>: Integrated to create fluid, high-quality transitions that guide the user through the narrative experience.

<u>Interactive Modules</u>: Developed a linear flow that leads users through problem-identification games, ending with direct links to real-world donation and support organizations.`,

        tech: ['React'],
        description: `<strong>The Vision</strong><br>
RP Community was designed to strengthen campus engagement at Republic Polytechnic by addressing a common student pain point: fragmented information. Important events, study resources, and announcements are often spread across multiple platforms, making it difficult for students to stay informed and involved. The vision was to create a single, inclusive digital hub where students could connect academically and socially in one place.

<strong>The Logic</strong><br>
To support a wide range of interactions—from event participation to note sharing—the platform was designed as a full-featured web application rather than a static information site. This allows students to actively contribute content instead of passively consuming it.

<u>Centralised Content System</u>: All campus-related activities such as events, notes, and community posts are brought together into one platform, reducing information fragmentation and improving accessibility.

<u>Role-Based Interaction</u>: While all users can view public content, logged-in students are empowered to create, edit, and manage their own posts, notes, and events, ensuring accountability and content ownership.

<u>Event Analytics & Dashboards</u>: Event organisers and administrators gain insights into engagement through RSVP counts, view tracking, and popularity metrics, enabling more data-driven planning and decision-making.
<strong>The Outcome</strong><br>
RP Community encourages active participation rather than passive scrolling. By combining social interaction, academic support, and event discovery in a single platform, it fosters a more connected student community, improves peer-to-peer learning, and increases overall engagement in campus life.
